## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### Continued development

- I find the filter color is a little weird. I don't know whether the color given is wrong or I need to do some adjustment on the color.
- I use mobile-first workflow. I find the workflow a bit weird when I want to put the item on the right position. At last I just set the width and height of the "card".
- I use react to listen resize of the window to change the layout of mobile to that of desktop. I wonder whether there are better method.
